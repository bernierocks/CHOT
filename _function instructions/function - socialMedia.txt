Current social media function:

Calling socialMedia('SOCIAL MEDIA ICON', 'SIZE', 'COLOR', 'CLASS'):
This is a PHP function, which means that if you're adding it to regular HTML, it must be surrounded in PHP tags(<? ?>)
socialMedia() currently has 3 options and they should be written in this order:
-SOCIAL MEDIA ICON
-SIZE (default 25px high)
-COLOR (default white, background color none)
-CLASS (optional - adds the class you designate to the social media icon.  This can later be styled easily in CSS)

The size and color are both optional.  If you wanted a white, 25px, facebook icon it could be written like this:
socialMedia('facebook')

If you needed a blue 35px twitter icon, it would be written like this in an HTML document (simply remove <? ?> for writing in PHP) :
<?socialMedia('twitter','35px','blue')?>

The current social media icon options are (all lower case!!):
blogger
facebook
google
instagram
instagram2
linkedin
pinterest
tumbler
twitter
vimeo
youtube
