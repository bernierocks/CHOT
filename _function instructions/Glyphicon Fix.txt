Glyphicon Fix

If glyphicons are not working, your problem is cross-domain rigamarole.

In order to fix it, we need to allow cross-domain access by editing the .htaccess file.

1) Download the .htaccess file from the server as it will not already be in your repo
2) Add the following lines of code to the .htaccess file:

Header add Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
Header add Access-Control-Allow-Headers "origin, x-requested-with, content-type"
Header add Access-Control-Allow-Methods "PUT, GET, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS"
